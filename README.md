# TAITraj
TAITraj is a comprehensive regional-scale multimodal dataset specifically designed for Spatiotemporal Trajectory Reconstruction. The dataset integrates heterogeneous data sources, including Automatic Vehicle Identification (AVI) records, vehicle images, traffic signal timings, and road network topology. 

This repository provides representative samples from both training and testing sets to demonstrate the standardized data structure. The complete dataset and benchmark algorithms will be released gradually.
